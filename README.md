# SOLVE-IT Education Resources

## Introduction
This repository is to host material that can be used for teaching using SOLVE-IT.

This is in early development. For the moment the following resources are available:
* A one page primer introducing SOLVE-IT
* Class exercises

Presentations and other material will follow at a later date.

### One Page Primer

This one page primer was created to quickly communicate the design and applications of SOLVE-IT. It is available as a PDF here:

[SOLVE-IT One Page Primer v1.0](https://github.com/SOLVE-IT-DF/solve-it-education/blob/main/one-page-primer/pdfs/SOLVE-IT%20-%20A%20One%20Page%20Primer%20v1.0.pdf)


### Class Exercises

These are exercises that hae been developed that can be used in class for students to make use of SOLVE-IT. These are freely available and may be adapted to your needs. At present PDFs are provided but in future these will be converted to markdown so that corrections, updates and enhancements can be supplied back by the community. If you develop your own SOLVE-IT exercises please consider uploading them here.

Each exercise contains a front page of information for instructors. This is indexed as page 0 so it can be removed if you want to issue the student information only from page 1 of the PDFs.

The exercises are mostly pre-v1 versions as they have not yet been tested. If you run these and there are problems, or they go well please do let us know. 

#### Reviewing class exercise examination workflows
This exercise is designed as an add-on to the end of a practical examination of a data source e.g. a disk image or phone extraction. Students will need to consider the tools and processes used, dissect them into component parts and map them against SOLVE-IT techniques.

#### Tool testing dataset creation
This exercise is designed to encourage students to think about how tools can go wrong, and how we can capture that in a dataset, and use that dataset to test tools.

#### Weakness Enumeration with TRWM and SHWAMA
This exercise will ask students to take a technique from SOLVE-IT, or one that is missing, and to systematically enumerate the weaknesses and mitigations associated with the technique. TRWM is the general approach of systematically considering: Technique, Result, Weaknesses and Mitigations.
